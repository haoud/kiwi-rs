/// The stack used by the kernel to handle interrupts and exceptions. Kiwi
/// has made the choice to use a single stack per core to handle interrupts
/// instead of using a separate kernel stack for threads.
/// This brings several advantages:
///     - Less memory usage, can save dozens of megabytes of memory
///       on a system with many threads.
///     - Better cache locality, as the kernel stack will have more
///       chances to be in the cache.
///     - Simpler code
/// The main inconvenience of this approach is that the kernel cannot be
/// preemted during the middle of its execution. However, this is less of
/// a problem for a microkernel like Kiwi, as most of the kernel code should
/// be simple and fast to execute. We can also use cooperative preemption by
/// leveraging the async/await feature of Rust to reduce the preemption latency
/// by allowing the kernel to yield the CPU to another thread when it is
/// waiting for an event.
